# Weather-Application-Using-Python
This Python-based Weather Application retrieves real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it in a Tkinter GUI. It shows details like temperature, humidity, and wind speed for any location and stores this data, along with the timestamp, in an SQLite database for future reference.
